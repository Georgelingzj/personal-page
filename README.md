### Biography
---------------------------------
I am currently a final year undergraduate at the [University of Nottingham](https://www.nottingham.ac.uk), major in computer science. I will work on my final year thesis 'Visual Tracking Using Convolutional Neural Nets' in the current academic year(21-22), supervised by [Prof. Tony Pridmore](https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/computerscience/people/tony.pridmore). Before that, I have spent time as an intern with [Dr. Jibo He](https://www.psych.tsinghua.edu.cn/xlxxen/info/1071/1099.htm) at Tsinghua University, [Mr. Kun Wu](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kskywu/) at [Ant Group](https://www.antgroup.com/en), [Prof. Xi Li](https://person.zju.edu.cn/en/xilics) at Zhejiang University.

My current research interest is computer vision, with special emphasis on visual traking and 3D point cloud. My ultimate research interests are computer vision and perception with application to make machine think/work like real human.

### About my life
-------------------------
I am from [Hangzhou](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hangzhou), a beautiful city in the southeast coast of China.

I have been a member of the school basketball team from primary school to university. The spirit of [Kobe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kobe_Bryant) makes me a brave and iron man. I enjoy doing workout regularly.


I love travelling a lot, I have went to 10 different countries with my family before covid-19.

### Note
---------------------------
- Sorry for my temporary personal web, I am busy with my GRE and TOEFL test(till end of Sept.) and reasearch work(till end of Nov.). I will make a pretty one before Nov. as well as put some organised projects on it
